  <h1 class="topictitle1">Localization Files Editor</h1>

  
  
  <div><p>Allows you to easily create text string files for new locales, to see which strings will be used in a given
    locale, and to identify strings that have yet to be translated, all without having to work directly in XML-formatted
    files.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>To start the Localization Files Editor, simply double-click one of the XML files containing the strings to be
        localized (or an XML file containing the localized strings). Within an Android project, the base strings file is
        res/values/strings.xml. </p>

      <div class="p">The Localization Files Editor should open, showing all of the strings defined in each of the <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> files in your project's resources directory. If it does not, open it as follows:<ol>
          <li>Right-click one of the the XML files containing localized strings.</li>

          <li>From the context-sensitive menu select <span class="menucascade">
              <span class="uicontrol">Open With</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Other</span>
            </span>.</li>

          <li>In the Editor Selection dialog select <span class="uicontrol">Localization Files Editor</span>.</li>

        </ol>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The Localization Files Editor forces every project to have a default values file (values.xml). If
          your project doesn't have one, when you open the editor this file will be created with empty keys.</div>
</div>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">The editor</h2>
      
      <p>The Localization Files Editor consists primarily of a table in which each row represents a key and each column
        (except the first, which contains the key names) represents a locale. Each locale column corresponds to a
          <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> file within a directory named for that locale. The table cells represent
        key/value pairs within the <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> files. Wherever a cell contains a value, the
          <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> file corresponding to the cell's column defines that value for the key
        corresponding to the cell's row. This tabular presentation allows you to quickly see, for a single key, the
        strings that will be displayed in each supported locale. It also makes evident those strings that don't have a
        value defined specifically for that locale.</p>

      <p>Within an Android project, you have a file that contains base, or default, values for each key: these values
        can be found in <span class="filepath">res/values/strings.xml</span> (if this file does not exist, it is created for you
        with blank values when you open the Localization Files Editor). These default values are used for string
        resources that aren't specifically defined for a given locale.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Options</h2>
      
      <p>The Localization Files Editor options are displayed immediately above the table. Normally these options are not
        displayed, to allow the table to occupy most of the view. Click the disclosure triangle next to the word
          <span class="uicontrol">Options</span> to show or hide the editor options. The Localization Files Editor has the
        following options:</p>

      <table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" border="1" class="simpletableborder">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
            <span class="uicontrol">Highlight Changes</span>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">When selected, those cells whose values that have changed since the underlying <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> files were last loaded or saved are highlighted. </td>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><span class="uicontrol">Show Cell Comments</span></td>

          <td valign="top">Causes comments attached to a given locale-specific string to be displayed when you hover over the
            cell (without clicking) in which the string value is defined. The text box that presents the comment is
            editable; simply click within the comment to edit it.</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
            <span class="uicontrol">Search values</span>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">Used to locate particular string values within the table. Those cells that contain the search string
            are highlighted. Note that the search not case sensitive.</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><span class="uicontrol">Filter by Key</span></td>

          <td valign="top">Limits the rows displayed in the table to those that contain the string entered here. The match
            between the filter string and the keys is case-insensitive.</td>

        </tr>

      </table>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Cell comments</h2>For each key/value pair defined for a given locale, you can also add a comment.
      If <span class="uicontrol">Show Cell Comments</span> is enabled (you may need to click <span class="uicontrol">Options</span> to
      see or change the state of this option), simply hover over a cell (without clicking) in which a value is defined
      and a floating text box will appear in which you can enter your comment or view the comment currently attached to
      the cell. Note that there must be a value in the cell in order to comment on it; you cannot apply comments to
      empty cells. Within the <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> file, the comment is attached to the string value like
        this:<pre class="codeblock">&lt;string name="app_name"&gt;Internationalisation Test&lt;!--This is the name of the app--&gt;&lt;/string&gt;</pre>
<p>If you delete the contents of a cell, any comments applied to that cell are also deleted.</p>
</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Context-sensitive commands</h2>
      
      <p>Right-click within the table to bring up a menu of commands.</p>

          <td valign="top"><span class="uicontrol">Show Columns</span>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">Show or hide value columns. Use this to hide locales that you aren't currently editing. Note that
            this command only controls the visibility of the columns; it does not affect the underlying XML files in any
            way. When you select this command you are presented with the set of "values" columns corresponding to the
            XML strings files in your project; those with check marks preceding them will be shown. Below the column
            list are two additional commands: <span class="uicontrol">Show All</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Hide All</span>, which
            show and hide all value columns, respectively.</td>

          </td>

          <td valign="top">Adds a new table row, corresponding to a string to be localized. You will be asked to supply the key,
            after which the row will be created with only the key filled in (all "values" columns for that key are left
            blank). Note that until you actually supply a value for that key, none of the XML strings file in your
            project are affected.</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><span class="uicontrol">Remove Key</span>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">Deletes the selected keys and their associated values from each of the XML strings files in your
            project that specify a value for those keys. Note that even locales whose corresponding columns are hidden
            are affected.</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><span class="uicontrol">Add Column</span>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">Creates a new column corresponding to a specific locale. You will be prompted for the column ID,
            which must follow the pattern for a localized string directory: <samp class="codeph">values-</samp><var class="varname">locale</var>, where <var class="varname">locale</var> follows the ISO 639-1 pattern for locale names. This
            command creates a directory named after the column ID and within it a <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> file
            that contains two tags: the <samp class="codeph">&lt;?xml&gt;</samp> tag that specifies the XML version and encoding
            (UTF-8), and an empty <samp class="codeph">&lt;resources&gt;</samp> tag. Use <span class="uicontrol">Clone</span> if you want to
            create a new locale that contains all of the keys and values defined in an existing locale.</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>

          </td>

          <td valign="top">Deletes the column that currently has the cursor. Because this command deletes the corresponding
              <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> file (and its parent directory, if it contains no other files), you are
            prompted to confirm the action.</td>

            a directory named after the ID of the new column and within it a <span class="filepath">strings.xml</span> file that
            is a copy of the one from the existing column.</td>
