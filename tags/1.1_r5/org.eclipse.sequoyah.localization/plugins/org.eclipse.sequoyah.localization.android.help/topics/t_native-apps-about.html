  <h1 class="topictitle1">Native Android Application Development</h1>

  <p>From within Eclipse you can develop Android applications that include native code. Once you have installed
    the necessary components and properly configured your development environment, for Android projects that have been
    enabled for native support your C/C++ code is compiled into a shared library that is included when the Java portions
    of your project are built. The Sequoyah Android feature provides other native application support: for instance, you
    can generate C++ classes from native method declarations in your Java source files.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/t_config-for-native.html">Configuring your development environment for native development</a></strong><br/>
After installing the Android NDK and a few other needed components, Eclipse can be configured to let you develop Android applications that include native (C/C++) code.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/t_project-adding-native.html">Adding native support to an Android project</a></strong><br/>
Android projects that have native support build the native components along with those rest of the project. At build time the Sequoyah Android feature compiles the native (C/C++) code into a shared library and then includes that shared library in the project APK.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/t_native-classes-generating.html">Generating native classes</a></strong><br/>
The Sequoyah Android feature lets you generate C++ classes from native method declarations in your Java source files. This allows you to focus on the native function implementations, rather than the mechanics of parameter passing between Java and native C/C++ code.</li>
