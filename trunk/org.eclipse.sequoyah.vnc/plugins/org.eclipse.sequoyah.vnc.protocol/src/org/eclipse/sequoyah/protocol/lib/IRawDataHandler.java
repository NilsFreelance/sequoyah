/**
 * DESCRIPTION: This interface describes the contract to be used by an object
 * which purpose is to handle a raw data field received/sent from/to the
 * communication stream. <br>
 * 
 * RESPONSIBILITY: Define methods that shall be implemented by objects that
 * read/write a raw data field from/to the communication stream.<br>
 * 
 * COLABORATORS: None.<br>
 * 
 * USAGE: The message definition contributors must provide a handler to raw data
 * fields if the message contains such fields. The raw data handlers must
 * implement this interface.<br>

	 * Reads raw data fields from stream. <br>

	 * The method provides an input stream from which the reader can retrieve
	 * data from the communication stream, as well as the message fields that
	 * were already retrieved until the invocation time. Besides, the
	 * implementer has access to the protocol being run (so that specific
	 * protocol data can be accessed if needed) as well as to a flag indicating
	 * if the protocol is big endian or not.<br>
	 * <br>
	 * The user is intended to read the needed data from the stream and return
	 * the field data in a Map implementation. The map entry key is the field
	 * name, which can be used by the message handler to retrieve the value read
	 * for further processing after this message is fully parsed.
	 * 
	 * If this protocol implementation needs only to write the raw field, this
	 * method can be left blank.
	 * 
	 * @param dataStream
	 *            The communication stream where to read bytes from.
	 * @param fields
	 *            All message fields already read from the stream until the
	 *            current moment.
	 * @param protocolImplementer
	 *            The protocol that is being executed. One can use this to
	 *            retrieve protocol specific information.
	 * @param isBigEndian
	 *            True if the protocol is big endian; false if it is little
	 *            endian.
	 * 
	 * @return A map containing the raw data fields already read. The keys must
	 *         match the field name that will be retrieved out of the protocol
	 *         message in the message handler.
	 * 
	 * @throws IOException
	 *             If an IO error occurs while trying to read from the input
	 *             stream.
	 * @throws ProtocolRawHandlingException
	 *             If the raw field cannot be parsed.
