 * DESCRIPTION: This interface describes the contract to be used by an object
 * which purpose is to define a protocol implementer instance. <br>
 * 
 * RESPONSIBILITY: Define methods that shall be implemented by objects that
 * represents a protocol implementer instance. At least one of the
 * initialization methods must be provided for the protocol to work.<br>
 * 
 * COLABORATORS: None.<br>
 * 
 * USAGE: The protocol implementer is declared by the user but instantiated by
 * the protocol framework at protocol start time. The initialization methods are
 * executed at this moment. It is expected that the user maintain at this class
 * any data referring to a single instance of the part (server or client)
 * running the protocol.<br>
